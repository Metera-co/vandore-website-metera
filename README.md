# Vandore Heritage Static Site

This repository contains the marketing website for Vandore Heritage. The site is organised for CloudCannon so you can edit every page visually and manage structured content (properties, rentals, blog posts) through collection editors.

> **Note:** The helper scripts are compatible with Node.js 18+, which matches CloudCannon's build environment.

## Local Preview

1. Install dependencies (installs the helper scripts only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the deployable site into `_site/`:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the `_site/` folder with any static server (examples):
   ```bash
   npx http-server _site -p 8080
   # or
   npx serve _site
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8080/index.html` (all other pages sit in the same folder).

When you change the HTML templates, edit the root-level `.html` files directly and commit the updates.

### Managing Listings and Blog Posts
CloudCannon collection schemas map to the JSON data files:
- **Properties** (`data/properties.json`, key `properties`)
- **Rentals** (`data/rentals.json`, key `rentals`)
- **Blogs** (`data/blogs.json`, key `blogs`)

Add or edit items through the editor to update the JSON consumed by the front-end filters.

### Adding New Assets
- Upload images through CloudCannon to `image/uploads/` to keep paths consistent.
- Reference uploads as `/image/uploads/filename.ext` in JSON or page content so they resolve locally, in the editor, and on the published site.

## Helpful Scripts
- `npm run build` – copies assets and normalises HTML paths into `_site/` for static deployment if needed.
