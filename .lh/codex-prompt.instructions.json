Structure the site into two clear sections:  \r\n   - Īpašumi (sale or long-term rent).  \r\n   - Īstermiņa īres (short-form rentals).  \r\n   Each section must have its own page, same grid layout, filters, and design consistency.  \r\n\r\n2. Ensure a fully visual editing experience for clients:  \r\n   - Ability to click on pictures or text and edit them without coding.  \r\n   - Content managed via an integrated CMS (e.g. Decap CMS or alternative) connected to GitHub + Netlify.  \r\n\r\n3. Deploy seamlessly to Netlify:  \r\n   - Research and configure build settings.  \r\n   - Ensure that when clients publish entries, the site rebuilds and updates automatically.  \r\n\r\n4. Maintain a professional, clean design:  \r\n   - Reuse and adapt the properties page design for short-form rentals.  \r\n   - Keep all labels, buttons, and descriptions in Latvian.  \r\n   - Guarantee consistent, working filters on both pages.  \r\n\r\n**Your role as CodeX:**\r\n- Explore and understand the current repo structure.  \r\n- Research external requirements (Netlify config, CMS setup, Eleventy filters).  \r\n- Edit and create necessary files to implement the two-page system (properties + short-term rentals).  \r\n- Add a CMS/admin layer so clients can log in, upload pictures, change text, and publish new listings.  \r\n- Verify everything works in Latvian with proper encoding.  \r\n- Deliver a website that clients can manage entirely through the browser, no coding required.  \r\n"
