## Demand stays resilient

After a quieter winter, enquiries from relocation clients have accelerated. This is especially visible in Riga's embassy district and coastal retreats where inventory is still limited.

## Pricing is steady, but expectations are not

Sellers who invest in light renovations and staging are consistently achieving 3–5% above asking. Buyers expect turnkey experiences and are making faster decisions when that bar is met.

## Regulation keeps the pace measured

Planned zoning updates in Jurmala will unlock new listings later in the year. Until then, buyers focused on short-term rental opportunities should look inland where yield remains competitive.
